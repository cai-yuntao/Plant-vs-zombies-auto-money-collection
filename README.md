# Plant-vs-zombies-auto-money-collection
Run this code to auto collect coins in Plant vs Zombies. 

My Screen is 1920 by 1080. The plant vs zombies screen is set so that the top left corner is (1110,410), and the bottom right corner is (1912,1033). 

Script will approximately generate 10000 coins per round, or 

Theoretically this code doesn't work for other screens right now but if it garners enough interest I'll make it modular for other screens. Its just the task of changing the postions of the mouse clicks.
